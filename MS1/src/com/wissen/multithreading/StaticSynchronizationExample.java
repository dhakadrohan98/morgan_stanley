/*
 * When a method is declared as static synchronized, 
 * it acquires a class-level lock (also known as a monitor).
 * Only one thread can hold the class-level lock at a time, preventing concurrent execution of 
 * static synchronized methods within the same class.
 * 
 * Remember that static synchronization should be used judiciously, as excessive synchronization can lead to performance bottlenecks. Choose the appropriate level of synchronization based on your applicationâ€™s requirements!
